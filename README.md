# Getting Started

Install needed packages by doing ``npm install``.

Grunt tasks will be enabled after the above.

``grunt`` will perform art direction (cropping, resizing), move images files to the right places, and compile SCSS files in ``scss/`` folder.

To perform further optimization via ``grunt-imageoptim``, do ``grunt optim-imag``.
